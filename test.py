You are an expert technical writer and AI engineer.  
Your task is to generate a detailed and professional README.md for my open-source project.  

## Project Context
- The project implements a **hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system.  
- It combines **dense embeddings** (from OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large`) and **sparse embeddings** (via Qdrant’s BM25 cloud inference).  
- Inspired by Anthropic’s contextual retrieval blog: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/contextual-retrieval.  
- The system uses **fixed-size chunking** (500 tokens per chunk, batches capped at ~200k tokens to stay within OpenAI embedding limits).  
- Data is chunked from PDFs, embedded, and uploaded in batches to **Qdrant Cloud**.  
- Queries use **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** to combine dense + sparse results for better retrieval.  
- A custom **Agent class** orchestrates LLM responses, tool calls, and memory management.  
- The chatbot is specialized for answering questions about the book *The Richest Man in Babylon*, using the hybrid retriever.  

## Code Highlights
- `pdf_to_chunks`: Converts PDFs into tokenized, batched chunks.  
- `store_chunks_as_embeddings`: Creates embeddings, generates Qdrant `PointStruct`s, uploads batches.  
- `knowledge_retriever`: Performs hybrid search with RRF across dense + sparse vectors.  
- `Agent`: Interactive loop that manages conversation, tool calls, and retrieval.  
- Entry point script: Initializes `Agent` with system instructions, tools, and `gpt-5` model.  

## README Requirements
Please write a **detailed README.md** with:  
1. **Introduction** – what the project does, why hybrid RAG is useful.  
2. **Features** – key technical features (chunking, hybrid search, RRF, Qdrant integration, etc.).  
3. **Installation Guide** – step-by-step setup:  
   - Clone repo  
   - Create and activate virtual environment  
   - Install dependencies (`requirements.txt`)  
   - Setup environment variables (`.env` with OpenAI + Qdrant API keys, Qdrant Cloud URL)  
4. **Usage** – how to:  
   - Chunk a PDF  
   - Embed + upload chunks  
   - Query the knowledge base  
   - Run the chatbot agent  
5. **Configuration** – explain adjustable params (chunk size, overlap, memory limit, top-k, etc.).  
6. **Example Workflow** – small walkthrough with a sample PDF + example query.  
7. **References** – Anthropic blog, Qdrant docs, OpenAI embeddings.  

Format the README in **Markdown** with proper code fences, headings, and bullet points.
